# IS-ENES3-Summer-School-2022

The Institute of Informatics &amp; Telecommunications at NCSR Demokritos is delighted to be co-organising, along with the IS-ENES3 consortium, and hosting in September 2022 the upcoming IS-ENES3 Summer School on Data Science for Climate Modelling. This Summer School aims to increase expertise and skills on theoretical and practical concepts of Data Science, building upon and mainly targeting how to accelerate scientific discovery from data. Early stage researchers will learn how to analyse, visualise and report on massive datasets, in the scientific domain as well as how to apply data-intensive and data-oriented paradigms and solutions to address scientific discovery in climate science.

This repository contains the code for reproducibility of one exercie proposed in the Summer School. See the attached notebook.
